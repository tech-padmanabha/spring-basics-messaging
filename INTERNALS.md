# Apache Kafka Server 
## Topics, partitions and offsets
1. Topics: a particular stream of data
   - Similar to a table in a database (without all the constraints)
   - You can have as many topics as you want
   - A topic is identified by its ***name***
2. Topics are split in *partitions*
   - Each partition is ordered
   - Each message within a partition gets an incremental id, called **offset**

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
